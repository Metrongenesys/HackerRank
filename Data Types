# Complete the code in the editor below. The variable i, d, s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
  # 1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type string.
  # 2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
  # 3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
    # 1. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
    # 2. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    # 3. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
    
    
i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank'

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = 7
b = 7.0
c = 'Hello'

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = str(input())

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i + a)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d + b)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line.
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(s + c)
