# Given the meal price (base cost of meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being
# added as tax)for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the rest to the nearest integer.


def solve(meal_cost, Tip_percent, tax_percent):
  tip = (meal_cost / 100.00) * tip_percent
  tax = (tax_percent / 100.00) * meal_cost
  total = meal_cost + tip + tax
  
  print(int(round(total))
