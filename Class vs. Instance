# Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as aparameter. The constructor must assign
# initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should
# set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0. 

# In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
#  - If age < 13, print 'You are young.'
#  - If age >= 13 and age < 18, print 'You are a teenager.'
#  - Otherwise, print 'You are old.'

  def _init_(self, initialAge):
    self.age = initialAge
    if self.age < 0:
